Wow... Loved this place.	
Thai Orchid's menu offers a vast choice of authentic Thai dishes.	

I guess if you're eating here, you don't really give a shit about money though.	

Sure, it's good, but it's garlic bread.		

Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	

The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	

Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	

Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh.)	

Price was very reasonable.	

Watery espresso with no crema--none.	

The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.

The fries were great too.	

A great touch.	
That wasn't even all that great to begin with?

One of the amazing berry crumb pies?	

Service was very prompt.	

Would not go back.	

I never know who is my actual server or who to order anything from.	

The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	

Oh Sura... A Carnivore's Playground!	

I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!
