Watery espresso with no crema--none.	

The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.

The fries were great too.	

A great touch.	
That wasn't even all that great to begin with?

One of the amazing berry crumb pies?	

Service was very prompt.	

Would not go back.	

I never know who is my actual server or who to order anything from.	

The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	

Oh Sura... A Carnivore's Playground!	

I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!	
These are a must try.	

This is pretty much standard SYSCO food supply.	

Frozen pucks of disgust, with some of the worst people behind the register.	
Spring rolls are delicious but small.	

Maybe I'm just fortunate, or maybe it's just that good!	
On the downside the sushi that came off of this menu was unappetizing and the chicken katsu was the best thing I had that day.	

My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages.	

The only thing I did like was the prime rib and dessert section.	
My dad goes here a LOT, like, the owner knows him by name.	

It's too bad the food is so damn generic.	

I came back after a couple of years to get my usual corned beef hash w/ scrambled eggs and hot chocolate.	

The burger is good beef, cooked just right.	

If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!
